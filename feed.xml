<p>Apache Mahout is for Mathematicians (or statisticians, or data scientists, etc.).  We understand not all users
are up to cloning and building from source, working with command line interfaces, and other such engineering 
tasks.</p>

<p>In that thread, we’ve created <a href="http://mahout.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/misc/getting-started-with-zeppelin/">The Apache Zeppelin Quickstart Docker Container</a>.</p>

<p>We hope this will make it easier for users to dip their toes in the Mahout waters. Let us know what you think on</p>

<ul>
  <li>user at mahout dot apache dot org</li>
  <li>dev at mahout dot apache dot org</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, we’re looking for users to get involved, and encourage any patches to be submitted to: https://github.com/apache/mahout</p>

<p>Thanks, and good Mahout-ing!</p>

<p>Trevor making (slow) progress wtih Py4J / Numpy / Python bindings (life getting in the way, but seems doable).</p>

<p>Palumbo interested in FPGA-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Investigation: FPGA4Mahout, Mahout BLAS Subroutines  on FPGA.  we are considering integration of the fBLAS library for FPGA acceleration of BLAS subroutines on mahout.  fBLAS accepts JSON expressions of algebraic subroutines and generates OpenCL code with Just In Time compilation and FPGA flashing.  We are first considering a Naive approach upon evaluation to convert the computation graph of a mahout expression into JSON, compile and Flash the FPGA and stream data through the FPGA in SIMD vectored fashion.</p>

  <p>The fBLAS library shows significant speedups over CPU BLAS operations.  If we find significant performance gains,  In conjunction with the current and ongoing effort to implement Python Bindings for Mahout, this could attract HPC developers with needs for near-real-time computation, by providing Python and Java bindings for FPGA accelerated matrix algebra available for distributed and in-core math.</p>

  <p>An end goal of this effort would be to provide scientists,  engineers, and others with little to no Hardware experience a Zeppelin Notebook on which they could  can develop models or circuits, using the mahout DSL, while concurrntly programming the model onto an FPGA”</p>

<p>Andrew Musselman is going to try to work on MAHOUT-2130 (Build talks page) this weekend. If you have / know of any 
content, please send it to him or just add it after he launches the page.</p>

<h3 id="issue-grooming">Issue Grooming</h3>

<p>The following issues are all related</p>

<ul>
  <li>MAHOUT-2122 Create getting started on Docker page</li>
  <li>MAHOUT-2134 Update Mahout in Zeppelin page</li>
  <li>MAHOUT-2129 Rebuild website docs, add Getting started with Zeppelin to Nav</li>
  <li>MAHOUT-2126 Update Zeppelin Containers</li>
  <li>MAHOUT-2133 Update “Getting Started in Mahout” page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The narrative is- we should update (or replace) the getting started in Mahout page with Getting Started with Mahout in 
Zeppelin. The Zeppelin Docker should have some more “Getting Started” Notebooks. The current Mahout in Zeppelin page 
should point to the new Mahout in Zeppelin on Docker page. The nav should be updated to reflect all of this.</p>]]></content><author><name>The Apache Software Foundation</name><email>dev@mahout.apache.org</email></author><category term="minutes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekly community meeting minutes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Weekly Meeting Minutes 2020-11-06</title><link href="http://mahout.apache.org//minutes/2020/11/06/weekly-meeting-minutes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Weekly Meeting Minutes 2020-11-06" /><published>2020-11-06T06:00:01+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-06T06:00:01+00:00</updated><id>http://mahout.apache.org//minutes/2020/11/06/weekly-meeting-minutes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://mahout.apache.org//minutes/2020/11/06/weekly-meeting-minutes.html"><![CDATA[<p>Weekly community meeting minutes.</p>

<p>Trevor has been doing some serious overhauling on the Apache Mahout entry on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>However, he’d appreciate it if people could fill out sections, especially if they have expertise.</p>

<p>Further- we would like to add architecture diagrams- both the original and the one with the
native solver- need to ask what the copyright it on those/if we can use them.</p>

<h3 id="topic-zeppelin-docker-image">Topic: Zeppelin Docker Image</h3>

<p>The Apache Zeppelin+Mahout docker image is live- you can get started with Mahout now by following the instructions
<a href="http://mahout.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/misc/getting-started-with-zeppelin/">here</a></p>

<h3 id="topic-starting-on-python-bindings">Topic: Starting on Python Bindings</h3>

<p>Trevor is going to start working on Python bindings. He thinks adding Mahout as a library for pyspark 
will significantly increase adoption. If anyone has experience using py4j or is otherwise interested in 
helping or wants to give words of encouragement reach out on dev or email him directly.</p>]]></content><author><name>The Apache Software Foundation</name><email>dev@mahout.apache.org</email></author><category term="minutes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Topic: Apache Mahout Wikipedia Page]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">14.1 Is Released!</title><link href="http://mahout.apache.org//news/2020/10/18/version-14-1-released.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="14.1 Is Released!" /><published>2020-10-18T22:16:01+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-18T22:16:01+00:00</updated><id>http://mahout.apache.org//news/2020/10/18/version-14-1-released</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://mahout.apache.org//news/2020/10/18/version-14-1-released.html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh happy day!
